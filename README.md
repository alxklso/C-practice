# C-practice
This is a repo containing some programs I wrote in C. The main topics implemented in these programs include:
- Bit shifting 
- Memory allocation (malloc)
- Simulated CPU/RAM function
- Data structures
- Algorithms 
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Some notes on the programs in this repo:
- program1.c covers OOP, data structures, algorithms, and memory allocation. Simulates a record system that can perform various functions
- program2.c covers
- program3.c covers
